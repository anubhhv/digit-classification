# 🖊️ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification  

This project explores **deep learning approaches** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

It demonstrates and compares:  
- 📘 A **Basic Feedforward Neural Network (MLP)**  
- 📗 A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- 📙 An **Advanced CNN** with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Callbacks

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Preprocessing: normalization, reshaping, one-hot encoding  
- ✅ Multiple models: Basic NN, CNN, Advanced CNN  
- ✅ Training history plots (loss & accuracy)  
- ✅ Confusion matrices for error analysis  
- ✅ Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)  
- ✅ Visualization of sample predictions  
- ✅ EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint in advanced model
