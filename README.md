# digit-classification
This project classifies handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using deep learning. It implements a basic neural network, a CNN, and an advanced CNN with regularization. The models are compared through accuracy, confusion matrices, and training curves, showcasing deep learning best practices.
